# Turtle-Crossing-Game
The "Turtle Crossing" game in Python is an arcade-style project where players control a turtle trying to cross a road filled with moving cars. Using the `turtle` module, players guide the turtle across the screen, avoiding collisions. The game features increasing difficulty as cars speed up with each successful crossing.
